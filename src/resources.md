To support long-read RNA-seq analysis, we have built an [online resource](https://kinnex-documentation-external.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for bulk and single-cell RNA isoform sequencing analysis. We hope this resource will serve as a useful guide for this feature rich data type.

Computational tools can be found on our [MDL github](https://github.com/MethodsDev).
