Please see our [github page](https://github.com/MethodsDev) for our latest computational tools and workflows!

In order to support long-read RNA-seq analysis, we have built an [online resource](https://kinnex-documentation-external.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for bulk and single-cell RNA isoform sequencing analysis from Kinnex data. Using latest methods and best practices, we have compiled a series of workflows and notebook vignettes to facilitate data processing and analysis. We hope this resource will serve as a useful guide for this new and feature rich data type.
